        <h1>EHRS ABSTRACT</h1>
        <h2>

In today’s living migration is one of the Social phenomenon's. People,
for various reasons, many a number of times keep moving from place 
to place. The first requirement and need in a new place is Housing or 
accommodation. Finding or getting good affordable accommodation 
in reasonably short time is a challenge. The problem is two ways for 
both House Owner’s (Searching a Tenant) and house renting 
community i.e., Tenants community. Though real estate and rental 
agencies exist, they are expensive or at time biased. 
It is very difficult for new entrants into a city going door to door in 
search of rental housing. Searching rental housing involves time, cost 
and familiarity of the place. Same way for house owners finding tenant 
involves time, cost and need good social networks. 
To overcome this complex situation, we have come out with an
Automation solution by proposing for development of software 
system known as “E-HOUSING RENTAL SYSTEM.” 
EHRS Aims to provide services to “House Owners”, “Migrating 
population”, “Real Estate Agencies” and other community that 
directly or indirectly dependent on migrating population.
EHRS facilitates various people in the community:
1) Provides house owner’s a platform to inform about their house 
details to customers (Tenants) that require housing.
2) Facilitates migrants in finding require accommodation in short 
time and at low cost.
3) Help real Estate agencies in focusing their business areas.
We can call this system as House Rental system also.</h2>
